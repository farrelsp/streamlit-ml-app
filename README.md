# Penguin Predictor App  

A simple Streamlit app designed to predict the species of penguins using a machine learning model. This project serves as a practice tool for honing skills with Streamlit and deploying applications on Streamlit Community Cloud.  

The app utilizes a Random Forest model to classify penguin species based on input features like bill length, bill depth, flipper length, island, and sex.
